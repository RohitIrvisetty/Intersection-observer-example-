# Intersection-observer
Intersection Observer is an API that is used to detect the interaction of a target element with itsâ€™s ancestor element or the document viewport. For example, if we want to detect if some element is visible in the viewport we can use this API for that purpose.

Historically, detecting visibility of an element, or the relative visibility of two elements in relation to each other, has been a difficult task for which solutions have been unreliable and prone to causing the browser and the sites the user is accessing to become sluggish. As the web has matured, the need for this kind of information has grown. Intersection information is needed for many reasons, such as:

Lazy loading images.
Detect if an element is in the viewport or not.
Auto-play a video if in the viewport, otherwise pause the video.
Infinite scrolling.
